Why did I design the webpage the way it is?
-------------------------------------------

Color and general design
    The color scheme of the red was chosen using the color picker used on the Visit London Logo thats how I got the color value #e0001b
    - The background also has a very subtle blue tint to it, I chose this blue by using the type of blue that is on the London underground signs because the sign is really iconic in London
    - There are various reds used on the webpage but they all stem from the same red used in the logo, I did this to keep consistency. The only elements that don't follow this rule is buttons that use a very very slightly different red and this is so they stand out
    - The narrow webpage design was a must to ensure I keep everything quick and to the point as the limited space made me make sure to only include what I want and maintain minimalism.
    - When designing I wanted the red to be used as tones rather than the design to make sure its subtle and not over powering
    - On the index page the Visitor Gallery and History Teaser titles are to the left on purpose because I wanted to shift the focus back into a document
    - The gallery was added to just add a bit of color and just make it look aesthetic


Navigation and Layout
    - I chose the layout I did because I knew there were going to be a lot of elements on various pages so I made a base standard page that I could manipulate for every purpose
    - The layout was really made like how the page would be made in a book if I could just write it, a very clear place this can be seen is the History teaser section or the visitor's gallery in the home page.
    - The navigation bar was quite simple in my original design it was vital that there was the logo in the navbar but it was proving hard as the first 4 hours was me trying to get the image to scale with bootstrap.
    - The whole reason there isn't much in the nav bar is because I wanted to keep it simple and clean as the task at hand was to make a minimalist website




What challenges did I faced?
----------------------------

There were no shortages of challenges as this was my first time making a website and using HTML and CSS properly. 
    - The webpage was loading slow after a certain point so I decided to compress my images down and this seemed to help a lot with speed.
    - One thing was that I use a very large monitor so for the longest time I would be confused about why the 100% in css or elements wouldn't automatically span the page and it was because I would set my zoom to 85% so when I solved that problem it fixed a lot of issues
    - Sizing elements to get them to be responsive when not using bootstrap at first was insanely difficult, primarily because of the lack of experience
    - Another problem was trying understand color schemes and get design ideas, I have never really been good at making good UI's but of course for a good webpage UI is everything so it was a struggle to say the least
    - Slightly building upon the last point I think understanding the differences between multiple attribute that at first glance do the same thing was quite difficult and was something I believe I only got to pick up through trial and error


Conclusion
----------

I think I everything went excellent and I met all the required tasks and made a well designed webpage. When I first started this assignment I didn't have the ability to make a simple responsive page but now after learning bootstrap and more css and being more familiar with them I'm quite comfortable

I think the next step would be to start using JavaScript to add more functionality to my pages.
