Why did I design the webpage the way it is?
-------------------------------------------

- The color scheme of the red was chosen using the color picker used on the Visit London Logo thats how I got the color value #e0001b
    - The background also has a very subtle blue tint to it, I chose this blue by using the type of blue that is on the London underground 






What challenges did I faced?
